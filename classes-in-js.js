/* -Omitting constructors-
If you want to make a class without allowing inputting unique data into it's constructor when it's called, then omit the constructor when creating a class, as a default constructor will be created for it by JS allowing us to take advantage of such a class */

/* Inheritance */

/* Encapsulation */
/* Encapsulation means that a class is enclosed in a certain way. Classes can vary in how they are encapsulated with some having less or more private or public fields. */
/* A hash sign (#) placed before a class field makes such class field a private class field only accessible inside it's class, this encapsulation is enforced by JavaScript itself. Class fields are public by default. */

      */

    #drive(){ /* because of the hash sign this is now a private method only accessible to the Car class itself yet since #drive() is called in the public method driveSpeed(), it's return result is included in driveSpeed()'s return statement when it's called as in jeep.driveSpeed() */
