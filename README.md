# MDN-Learning
Using https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn to learn and recording my progress with this repo.

I comment along with my code to explain what I'm learning.

At the time of creating this repo I'm well experienced with HTML5, CSS, and JS.
But I'm learning some new things and getting good practice by following along with MDN's web development learning path.

(things are in chronological order below)

I've been working through this MDN curriculum everyday since I started but somehow didn't contribute on GitHub last 2 days.

note on July 7 @ 3:39pm ( I'm going to go make a json file in my moportfolio repo and start creating an asynchronous JS frontend app project for my portfolio.
I'm thinking about making a game or story generator. )
