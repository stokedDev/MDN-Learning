# MDN-Learning
Using https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn to learn and recording my progress with this repo.

At times I comment along with my code to explain what I'm learning.

At the time of creating this repo I'm well experienced with HTML5, CSS, and JS.
But I'm learning some new things and getting good practice by following along with MDN's web development learning path.

I'm making a folder for each group of lessons within the "Learn Web Development" course by Mozilla.
